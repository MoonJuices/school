Bugs: If you type a code in wrong, you may run into some problems? Program will output Errors when
a code is input incorrectly.

Summary: My program will write out to 3 .txt files "cars.txt", "manufacturers.txt", and "dealers.txt".
The program is then capable of listing the cars and dealers in the files, and is also capable of finding
cars made by specific manufacturers and finding cars in specific zipcodes.
