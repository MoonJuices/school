Purpose: This .txt file is a statement of my observations from the
accompanying .cpp file.
The profit calculation value appears to be proportional to the number of
animal parts and inversely proportional to the number of animal types. In
other words, the profit calculation goes up as the number of animal parts
goes up and the profit calculation goes down as the number of animal types
goes up.
